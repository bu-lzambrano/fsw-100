Week 4 assignment (Complete Project 2: Create a Styled Website)

For this assignment, you’ll build on what you’ve learned by creating a basic HTML5 website, 
but also styling the website, as you apply your CSS coding skills. 
Your next two projects will be similar to this one, but with more features/tools, 
so make sure you thoroughly understand how to apply the fundamental tasks included in this project. 

To complete this assignment, you will create a website using HTML and CSS for a fake (or real) business.
It’s time to not only demonstrate HTML and CSS fundamentals, but also to show off your creativity!

Your website must include:

A navbar (this will be a single page website so functional links are not needed)
header
footer
main section.

    main section must include at minimum:
      image(s)
      text
      list(s)
      and table(s). 

Feel free to add other elements as you see fit. Remember: coding is about practicing code!

You must use:

The CSS box model to better space elements (making use of margins, borders, and padding).
The CSS layout position property.
A google font (you will need to go to fonts.google.com (Links to an external site.) and get the url for a <link /> on their HTML page)
CSS style sheet (no inline styling)
HTML5 semantic tags

Note:  
If we have time in our Week 5 Live Event, you’ll have a chance to present the website you built.
Another important skill of a web developer is the ability to speak to what, why and how you coded something.
So, take the chance to practice this skill and volunteer during live class, if given the opportunity!
